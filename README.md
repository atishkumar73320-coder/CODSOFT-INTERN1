# Titanic Survival Prediction Model


This project uses the **Titanic dataset** to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. It is a classic beginner-level project for learning data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification modeling.


## Project Overview
- Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical features (Sex, Embarked)
- Build a **Logistic Regression model**
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix


## Dataset
The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers such as:
- Passenger class (`Pclass`)
- Sex (`Sex`)
- Age (`Age`)
- Number of siblings/spouses (`SibSp`)
- Number of parents/children (`Parch`)
- Fare (`Fare`)
- Port of embarkation (`Embarked`)
- Survival status (`Survived` - Target)
